#🍕 Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Machine Learning

##🎯 Project Objective
This project predicts food delivery time (in minutes) using machine learning by analysing factors such as distance, traffic, weather conditions, and delivery partner details.
Goal: Improve ETA accuracy for platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, UberEats.

##📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains detailed records of food deliveries, including:
Delivery partner information
Restaurant and customer locations 
Traffic and weather conditions
Type of order and vehicle
Number of deliveries in a trip
Time-related features (hour, day, peak hour, festival status)
Actual delivery time (target)

##🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

###1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Removed irrelevant ID columns
Encoded categorical features


###2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Calculated distance using coordinates
Extracted order hour and day of week
Added peak-hour and festival indicators


###3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Weather vs Delivery Time
Traffic vs Delivery Duration
Distance vs Delivery Time
Correlation Heatmap


###4️⃣ Model Building
Algorithms used:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor


###5️⃣ Evaluation Metrics
MAE
RMSE
R² Score

##📊 Model Performance
Model	MAE	RMSE	R² Score
Linear Regression	5.1	6.2	0.68
Random Forest	2.9	3.4	0.89

✔ Best Model: Random Forest
✔ Average Error: ≈ 3 minutes

🔍 Key Insights
Distance and traffic play the biggest role in delivery duration
Peak hours and festival days increase delays
Random Forest handles non-linear patterns better than Linear Regression
